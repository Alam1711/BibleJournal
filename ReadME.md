Bible Jounral App

My Bible Journal App is designed to engage users to help them along with their Bible Journey. One feature that I talked about in my proposal was a daily accountability system. In my app I've implimented a daily verses app that gives you a different verse depending on the day of the week. This way the user is consitantly in the word with something fresh everyday. Another function that I talked about in my proposal was the ability to keep a journal and store prayer requests. The "My Prayer Journal" Button allows the user to write and store journal entries every single day. The user has a lot of freedom with this journal because they have the ability to put notes, commends and prayer requests in it. This was a big funciton that I really liked in my project proposal. Another function that I was realy happy about was the ability to view lessons and edit them to make them your own personally tailored lesson plans. The lesson plans button allows the user to read and view lessons while also being able to edit them and add notes to make it more personal. My favorite function  was the ability to add and save verses to your verses Journal. The left most button allows the user to add a verse to their memorization page. I also allowed the uesr to check off which partner's they would like to memorize it with them. In the menu they can check off if their partner memorized it or not to help them keep track of which verses they need to keep up with. This is also another feature that I am a big fan of. This concludes my project, I'm happy to say that I was able to put my imagination onto the screen. I hope in the future I can expand upon this and add more functions! Thank you for reviewing my project.
